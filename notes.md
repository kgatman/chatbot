### Use Cases
- look at how to process CSV data
	- user has data in CSV 
- also look at how to process SQL data
- basic prompts to test with
	- what was a measles data for Q4?
	- how many clients were tested positive for HIV this month in Maseru?
- Checkout RAG over SQL
- LLM SQL plugin
- The datastore will be based on Object Storage

Research 
- Local instance of SQL and research how to link deepseek model to the DB
- there should be a plugin out there
